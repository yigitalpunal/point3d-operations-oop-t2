# Task 2 – Point3D Class in C++

## Description

This task involves creating a `Point3D` class that represents a point in 3D space. It uses OOP principles such as encapsulation and operator overloading.

### Features:

- Default and parameterized constructors
- Getter and setter methods for x, y, z
- Input (`>>`) and output (`<<`) operators
- Overloaded `+` operator to add two points
- Overloaded `+=` operator to shift a point by an integer
- Uses `friend` functions

## Files

- `main.cpp`: Source code for the Point3D class and example usage

## How to Compile and Run

g++ main.cpp -o point3d
./point3d

## Example Output

Enter x: 1
Enter y: 2
Enter z: 3

Point 1: (1, 2, 3)
Point 2: (3, 4, 5)
point1 + point2 = (4, 6, 8)
After point1 += 4: (5, 6, 7)
